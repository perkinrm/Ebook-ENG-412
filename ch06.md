"The Beast" would not have been possible without the careful observation and analytic prowess of our fearless adventurers. Most of them made it back from their journey with all of their digits intact, and for that we are grateful.

We are also indebted to Madeline Hrybyk for her willingness to get up-close and personal with all of the critters.

A big thank you is also due to our chief wilderness explorer, Dr. Timothy Lockridge, whose sound advice and unfailing guidance kept us on track when the path seemed impassable. 

And here's to you, readers, for braving the wilds with us. Keep exploring.
