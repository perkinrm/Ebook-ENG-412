# Introduction

In the fall of 2014 a small team of dedicated researchers entered the unknown. Their goal: to identify and document the lesser-known writing applications that roam the uncharted wilds.

Armed with only their wits and a stable wifi connection, the team braved the harsh conditions of the technological jungle. Our researchers got their hands dirty, engaging the applications in their natural environment for the most accurate analysis possible. The applications they encountered vary in appearance and purpose, but each one has the potential to be a great addition to any writer’s arsenal.

“The Beast,” as you may have guessed, does not merely refer to the specimens you will see in this guide. Our team is concerned not only with the beasts lurking in the wild, but also the ones that dwell a little closer to home. If you are the adventurous sort (and we suspect that you are), then you undoubtedly already know them well. They delay and distract us, turn us around in circles, and prey on our hesitation and doubt.

This guide was assembled to help writers like you gather the tools you’ll need to hold your own against the seemingly indomitable foe that plagues even the most experienced among us: the writing process itself.

Whether you’re a seasoned writing veteran or a plucky first-timer, this field guide contains the basic information that every writer needs when approaching these applications on their home turf. You’ll learn how they’ve adapted to survive, what vulnerabilities they must make up for, and how they can best aid you as a prospective user.

If you ever decide to pack your bags, strap on your sturdiest boots, and tackle the wilds firsthand, we hope that you will keep this field guide close as you explore.

Best of luck, adventurer!
