#Apps for Productivity


##Specimen 1: Self Control
Jenna Tiller
* **Use**: Blocks Websites
* **Cost**: Free
* **Developer**: Charlie Stigler of Zaption and Steve Lambert

###Basic Knowledge:

Self Control is a handy little application that will block websites for you, preventing distraction before it even occurs. The user can add whichever websites they want to the “blacklist,” or the sites that will be blocked once the application is activated. They can then set a time for the application to run, during which Self Control will block the servers for the blacklisted websites. This means that once you turn Self Control on, all those social media and entertainment websites that can be so distracting will no longer be available. 

###Characteristics:

* **Blocking**: self Control blocks the servers of user-selected websites
* **Time Limits**: the user sets a time limit from 15 minutes to 24 hours

###Adaptations:

Self Control can be used for computers alone, but it has both Mac and PC versions. It also has older versions available for older operating systems. Both the blacklist and block time can be determined by the user, so there is a lot of room for customization. 

###Vulnerabilities:

Sometimes, effectiveness is vulnerability. Once the application has been activated nothing can turn the website blocks off, not even uninstalling the application or restarting your computer. So if you accidentally set a block for longer than you wanted or if you need to cancel it, there is no choice but to wait it out. Additionally, if something were to go wrong with the software, it would be a very difficult problem to fix since uninstalling it does not cancel the block. 

On a more personal note, Self Control is only as powerful as the user because the user sets the blacklist. In order for it to be truly effective, the user has to block any site that will distract them. 

###Compatibility: 

Self control is easy to install and simple to use, and is compatible with a wide range of operating systems and hardware. It is also highly customizable so the user can pick exactly which websites to block and for how long they want to block them.
