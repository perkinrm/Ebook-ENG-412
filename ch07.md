Jenna Tiller
* **Use**: Blocks Websites
* **Cost**: Free
* **Developer**: Charlie Stigler of Zaption and Steve Lambert

###Basic Knowledge:

Self Control is a handy little application that will block websites for you, preventing distraction before it even occurs. The user can add whichever websites they want to the “blacklist,” or the sites that will be blocked once the application is activated. They can then set a time for the application to run, during which Self Control will block the servers for the blacklisted websites. This means that once you turn Self Control on, all those social media and entertainment websites that can be so distracting will no longer be available. 

###Characteristics:

* **Blocking**: self Control blocks the servers of user-selected websites
* **Time Limits**: the user sets a time limit from 15 minutes to 24 hours
